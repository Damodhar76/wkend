            <button class="faq-button" onclick="toggleAnswer('faq-answer-5')">When was WKND founded?</button>
            <div id="faq-answer-5" class="faq-answer">
                <p>WKND was created in 2015 when our founders, Daniel and Kilian, realized that their friends and family were constantly using them as resources to find fun things to do while they were in Los Angeles. They loved sharing ideas about fun events and activities they knew of, but wanted to be able to do it at a larger scale across communities. They decided to start WKND as a way to share their insights and experiences with as many people as possible.</p>

        <!-- FAQ Item 6 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-button" onclick="toggleAnswer('faq-answer-6')">Is a hot dog a sandwich?</button>
            <div id="faq-answer-6" class="faq-answer">
                <p>While it may be described as meat between two pieces of bread, a hot dog is just a sandwich in the same way Michael Jordan was just a basketball player or William Shakespeare was just a playwright. Technically true, but vastly understated.</p>

        <!-- FAQ Item 7 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-button" onclick="toggleAnswer('faq-answer-7')">Is WKND a real company?</button>
            <div id="faq-answer-7" class="faq-answer">
                <p>No. The WKND is a fictional online magazine and adventure company that focuses on outdoor activities and trips across the globe. The WKND site is designed to demonstrate functionality for Adobe Experience Manager. There is also a corresponding tutorial that walks a developer through the development. Special thanks to Lorenzo Buosi and Kilian Amendola who created the beautiful design for the WKND site.</p>
